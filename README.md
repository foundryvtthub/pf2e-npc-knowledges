# FoundryVTT PF2e Npc Knowledges

This module adds the ability to set the Recall Knowledge Lores of NPCs.

![](./readme/edit.webp)

A new `Edit` button is added to the `Recall Knowledge` section of the NPC sheet which opens a new window where both the `Unspecified` and `Specific` lores can be set.

More than one of each can be set, simply by separating them with commas.

![](./readme/result.webp)

Once saved, the custom Lores will replace the generic ones on the sheet.
